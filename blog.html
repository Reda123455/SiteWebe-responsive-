      <h2>Why individuals won’t fix online misinformation — but they’re the best option we’ve got</h2>
      <h5>The internet has its own climate crisis</h5>

      <p>Earlier this month, we published a guide to figuring out what’s real on the internet — whether that means spotting a malicious “fake news” site or an innocent post with bad information. We also explained that individuals can only do so much. Schools, governments, web platform owners, and other institutions need to tackle bigger issues at a structural level. But that’s a much tougher task, and it might require a new way of thinking about the internet.

        Whitney Phillips is an expert on the dark side of internet culture. She’s the author of trolling ethnography This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things as well as the Data & Society report The Oxygen of Amplification, which laid out a toxic feedback loop between well-meaning journalism and harmful propaganda. Now, drawing on social media scholar Claire Wardle’s term “information pollution,” she and College of Charleston scholar Ryan Milner are writing a book that reframes the digital world as an ecosystem in crisis.</p>

      <p>Only the best deals on Verge-approved gadgets get the Good Deals stamp of approval, so if you're looking for a deal on your next gadget or gift from major retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, Target, and more, this is the place to be.

        It’s officially crunch time for buying gifts before the holidays arrive. If you haven’t yet begun your shopping, it’s time to start now, because if you wait much longer, it’s possible that your gifts won’t arrive on time — or you’ll pay much more for them to be delivered. On the other hand, you’ll probably appreciate that most retailers are offering the year’s best deals on the most popular tech products right now.</p>
